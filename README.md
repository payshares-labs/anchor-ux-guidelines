# Anchor UX Guidelines #

## This document describes guidelines for anchors in order to provide amazing UX to users. ##

Good user experience (UX) is important: it creates obvious and seamless flows for users to follow which in turn reduces user error and increases trust in the product. The more high-quality your UX is, the more likely users will continue to use and have faith in your integration.

Additionally, wallets are protective of their users’ experience for the same reason and will not want to offer your service unless the UX is up to their expectations. When we bring new anchors to a wallet, they do their own due diligence and evaluate your service, and submit feedback if they have any. This feedback will include UX suggestions if they see anything they’d like changed. Once the issues are resolved, they'll integrate your service and your application will officially be launched to the public.

### Guideline ###
#### Loading States #### 
All loading states should have a clear interface feedback, such as a loading bar or a spinner.

#### Languages #### 
All anchors should support both english and spanish in their interactive flow.

#### Error Messages #### 
Errors messages should be easy to understand and describe what users should do next.

#### Brand ####
Make it clear to users that they are interacting with your institution by showing the logo and the name on a first interaction and keeping the brand consistent throughout the process.

#### Color Scheme ####
The colors used in the interactive flow should be aligned with their brand guidelines, but also not have a big contrast with Vega's colors.

#### Response Time ####
All actions shouldn't take more than 15 seconds to be completed (considering a perfect network environment).

#### Text Fields  ####
All text fields should have a minimum height, and not clip their content.

#### Highlight Selected Fields  ####
All fields should have their highlighted states visible (e.g. with a colorful border), so users have a clear understanding of what's being edited.

#### Back button ####
If you have multiple screens in a form, or flow, allow users to go back to previous screens with a back button.
