# Anchor UX Guidelines & Templates #

## This document describes how we should provide templates and guidelines for the anchors to create amazing UXs. ##

### Guideline ###
#### Loading States #### 
All loading states should have a clear interface feedback, such as a loading bar or a spinner.

#### Languages #### 
All anchors should support both english and spanish in their interactive flow.

#### Error Messages #### 
Errors messages should be easy to understand and describe what users should do next.

#### Text Legibility ####
All text should have a minimum font size and a good contrast with the background.

#### Clickable Areas ####
All fields, and buttons, should have a minimum clickable area.

#### Brand ####
Make it very clear to users that they are interacting with your institution, clearly show the logo and the name on a first interaction and keep the brand consistent throughout the process.

#### Color Scheme ####
The colors used in the interactive flow should be aligned with their brand guidelines, but also not have a big contrast with Vega's colors.

#### Response Time ####
All actions shouldn't take more than 15 seconds to be completed (considering a perfect network environment).

#### Text Fields  ####
All text fields should have a minimum height, and not clip their content.

#### Highlight Selected Fields  ####
All fields should have their highlighted states visible (e.g. with a colorful border), so users have a clear understanding of what's being edited.

#### Back button ####
If you have multiple screens in a form, or flow, allow users to go back to previous screens with a back button.

#### Responsive Layouts ####
The system will be used on different screen sizes, so make sure the layout works well on all different sizes.
